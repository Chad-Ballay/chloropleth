# Chloropleth
A choropleth map (from Greek χῶρος ("area/region") + πλῆθος ("multitude")) is a thematic map in which areas are shaded or patterned in proportion to the measurement of the statistical variable being displayed on the map, such as population density or per-capita income.

Choropleth maps provide an easy way to visualize how a measurement varies across a geographic area or show the level of variability within a region. A heat map is similar but does not use geographic boundaries.
